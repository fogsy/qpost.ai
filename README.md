## ⚡ What is QPost?
**QPost.ai** is not just another directory. It is a **Launchpad + Auction House + War Room** for the next generation of AI founders. 

We combine a **Product Hunt-style discovery feed** with a **"Drop Culture" Service Marketplace**, giving builders the tools they need to launch, monetize, and scale—fast.

> **"Traffic is vanity. Revenue is sanity."** > QPost is built for founders who want to sell, not just be seen.
